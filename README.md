# Grosbeak Bioacoustics Microphone
An open-source horn microphone for bioacoustics specializing in capturing nocturnal flight calls of migratory birds.

The Grosbeak Bioacoustics Microphone was created by J'orge Garcia in collaboration with Benjamin M. Van Doren, Madison Chudzik, and Sara Lipshutz, and Jocelyn Brito for nocturnal flight call monitoring from rooftops in Chicago, IL.


## Build Materials
- 3D-printed Horn, Seal, and Grill using ASA Filament
- 12" x 12" sound-dampening foam, cut in half
- Polypropylene or polyethylene tape
- 80-gauge cling wrap
- 4" zip ties or 6" zip ties (UV-resistant)
- 14" zip ties or 24" zip ties (UV-resistant)
- Heavy-duty UV-resistant rubber band
- Acoustically transparent mesh 
- 2" x 0.04" felt strip

## Build Instructions
1. Turn the Horn so it's facing upward.
2. Line the inside with 2, 12x6in pieces of sound-dampening foam and fold any excess inward
3. Use small zip ties to secure the horn to the seal.
4. Trim the zip ties.
5. Flip the horn over and cut a swatch of 8 gauge wrap large enough to hang halfway down the sides
6. With two people, have one person hold the wrap taught while the other tapes down each wall with four pieces of poly tape.
7. Use additional tape as necessary, and finish with a final warp around all four walls.
8. Grab the 3D-printed grill and stick felt pieces on each corner base.
9. Carefully sit the grill on top of the horn.
10. From the bottom, loop the long zip tie through the vertically aligned holes, connecting the seal to the horn to the grill. DO NOT TIGHTEN
11. Once all four zip ties are installed, give all four equal tension, making slow adjustments to each side until the unit is completely secured.
12. Trim the zip ties
13. Cut a piece of 20x20 mesh.
14. Lay mesh over the grill as evenly as possible and secure it with a UV-resistant rubber band over the top.
15. Install your microphone element.
16. Use the mounting features with appropriate zip ties to secure the microphone to your recording device and environment.
